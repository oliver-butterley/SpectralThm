# Integral with respect to a complex-valued measure

Three options come to mind for defining the integral with respect to a complex-valued measure:

1. Define the integral with respect to a complex measure by decomposing the measure into real and imaginary parts and then using the definition of integral with respect to a signed measure. I.e.,
```
noncomputable def integral (μ : SignedMeasure α) (f : α → G) : G :=
    ∫ a, f a ∂μ.toJordanDecomposition.posPart - ∫ a, f a ∂μ.toJordanDecomposition.negPart
```
In turn, the integral with respect to as signed measure is defined using the Jordan decomposition
into positive and negative parts.

2. Develop directly the integral with respect to any `VectorMeasure` by introducing simple
functions, etc.

3. Use the polar decomposition of a complex measure into total variation measure and angular
function and hence use the definition of a Bochner integral.

It is unclear what the best design choice is so at the moment we opt for using polar decomposition
as the definition.

Whatever the direction taken with these definitions, the different components should be separated
into their own files.

## Main definitions

* `ComplexMeasure.integral`

## Notation

* `∫ a, f a ∂μ` : integral of `f` with respect to a `ComplexMeasure` `μ`

    ∫ a, f a ∂(μ + ν) = ∫ a, f a ∂μ + ∫ a, f a ∂ν := by
  dsimp [integral]
  /- **Proof outline**:
  - Every complex measure `μ` has polar decomposition `μ = h · |μ|` where `|μ|` is
    the total variation (positive measure) and `|h| = 1` a.e.
  - By definition `∫ f dμ = ∫ (f · h) d|μ|`
  - We use a common dominating measure to avoid relating different polar decompositions
    Let `λ := |μ| + |ν| + |μ + ν|` (finite positive measure)
  - By RN theorem, ∃ `g₁, g₂ ∈ L¹(λ)` such that:
    - `dμ = g₁ dλ`
    - `dν = g₂ dλ`
    - `d(μ + ν) = (g₁ + g₂) dλ`
  - Use linarity with respect to positive measures:
    ∫ f d(μ + ν) = ∫ f(g₁ + g₂) dλ       -- by definition
                  = ∫ fg₁ dλ + ∫ fg₂ dλ  -- linearity w.r.t. positive measure λ
                  = ∫ f dμ + ∫ f dν      -- returning to the original measures
